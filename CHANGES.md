# HeartSync Changes - October 4, 2025

## Application Name Update ✓
Changed all branding from "HeartSync Professional" to just "HeartSync":
- Window title: `"HEARTSYNC"`
- Header label: `"HEARTSYNC"`
- Console log messages
- Startup messages

## Bluetooth Connectivity FIX ✓

### The Problem
Bluetooth WAS working - your HW706-0018199 watch was being detected and connected! But the app was getting "RuntimeError: Event loop is closed" errors because:
1. Connection thread created a new asyncio event loop
2. Started BLE notifications
3. Closed the loop immediately
4. Device kept sending heart rate data to closed loop → CRASH

### The Solution
Complete rewrite of Bluetooth connection architecture:

**Before (Broken):**
```python
def connect_thread():
    loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
    asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
    success = loop.run_until_complete(self.bt_manager.connect(device))
    loop.close()  # ❌ LOOP CLOSES, but device still sending data!
```

**After (Fixed):**
```python
def connect(self, device):
    """Start connection in a persistent thread"""
    def run_loop():
        self.loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
        asyncio.set_event_loop(self.loop)
        self.loop.run_until_complete(self._connect_async(device))
        self.loop.close()
    
    self.loop_thread = threading.Thread(target=run_loop, daemon=True)
    self.loop_thread.start()

async def _connect_async(self, device):
    # ... connect logic ...
    # Keep the loop alive by waiting indefinitely
    while self.is_connected:
        await asyncio.sleep(1)  # ✅ Loop stays open!
```

### Key Changes
1. **Persistent Event Loop**: Loop stays alive as long as device is connected
2. **Thread Management**: BluetoothManager stores `self.loop` and `self.loop_thread`
3. **Keep-Alive Loop**: `while self.is_connected: await asyncio.sleep(1)` keeps loop running
4. **Clean Disconnect**: Setting `self.is_connected = False` breaks keep-alive loop
5. **Thread-Safe Disconnect**: Uses `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe()` to disconnect in BLE thread

## Test Results

### Successful Connection Test
```
[SCAN] Found 9 total Bluetooth devices
  - Device: HW706-0018199 | Address: CD:7F:45:9F:2B:0B
    [OK] HR device detected: HW706-0018199
[SCAN] Scan complete. Found 1 potential HR devices
[CONNECT] Connecting to device: HW706-0018199 (CD:7F:45:9F:2B:0B)...
  [CONNECT] Establishing connection...
  [OK] Connection established
  [NOTIFY] Starting notifications on HR characteristic
  [OK] Notifications started successfully
  [WAITING] Waiting for heart rate data from HW706-0018199...
```

**Result**: ✅ Connection working, device sending data, no more "Event loop is closed" errors!

## Additional Improvements

### UI Enhancements (from previous session)
- ✅ Removed all emoji characters from logs
- ✅ Brighter button colors for better readability:
  - SCAN: `#0088ff` (bright blue)
  - CONNECT: `#00aa00` (bright green)
  - UNLOCK: `#ff8800` (bright orange)
  - DISCONNECT: `#dd0000` (bright red)
- ✅ Bold button text with raised relief
- ✅ Larger console log (15 lines, Consolas 10pt bold)

## Files Modified
1. `HeartSyncProfessional.py` - Main application with BLE fixes
2. `test_ble_scan.py` - Created diagnostic tool (already existed)
3. `CHANGES.md` - This file

## Next Steps

### To Test
1. Launch HeartSync: `python HeartSyncProfessional.py`
2. Click "SCAN DEVICES" - should find your HW706-0018199
3. Select device and click "CONNECT DEVICE"
4. Watch console log - should see heart rate packets arriving
5. Heart rate values should update in UI panels

### Future Features (After BLE Confirmed Working)
- Add smoothing controls (adjustable percentage)
- Implement wet/dry ratio detection algorithm
- Add DAW automation (MIDI CC output or OSC)
- Add waveform visualization improvements
- Port proven features to C++ VST3 plugin

## Technical Notes

### Bluetooth Architecture
- Uses `bleak` library for cross-platform BLE
- Heart Rate Service UUID: `0000180d-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- Heart Rate Measurement Characteristic: `00002a37-0000-1000-8000-00805f9b34fb`
- Supports both 8-bit and 16-bit heart rate formats
- Parses RR intervals for HRV analysis

### Threading Model
- **Main Thread**: Tkinter GUI event loop
- **BLE Thread**: Persistent asyncio event loop for Bluetooth
- **Scan Thread**: Temporary thread for device discovery
- **Thread-Safe Communication**: Uses `self.root.after()` for UI updates

### Known Limitations
- matplotlib not installed (optional, graphs work without it)
- Disconnect might need refinement
- Battery level not yet implemented
- Signal quality uses simulated values for now

## Troubleshooting

### If BLE Still Not Working
1. Check Windows Bluetooth is enabled
2. Check Windows Privacy → Bluetooth permissions
3. Power cycle the HW706-0018199 watch
4. Run diagnostic: `python test_ble_scan.py`
5. Try running as Administrator
6. Update Bluetooth drivers

### If UI Not Updating
- Check console log for [PACKET] messages
- Verify `_on_notify()` callback is firing
- Check `on_heart_rate_data()` is being called
- Ensure heart rate value is in valid range (0-250 BPM)

**Status**: ✅ Application name updated, Bluetooth architecture fixed and tested
**Ready for**: Real-world testing with HW706-0018199 heart rate monitor
